### Experience

- **Research Assistant (2021-Current), University of Houston**

I developed a software tool for predicting the likelihood of failure in irregular mechanical structures. I implemented computer code in Python to numerically model the mechanical structures (beam and shell elements). I tested and debugged the program and conducted mathematical analysis through numerical simulations.



- **Research Assistant (2020-2021), International Tomography Center**

I developed a custom software solution to solve an optimization problem related to molecule structure. I collaborated with domain experts to design experiments that generated valuable data for optimization software. I utilized EasySpin (Matlab toolbox) and Pandas to handle and analyze experimental data.
