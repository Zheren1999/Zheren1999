Experience

- **Research Assistant (2021-Current), University of Houston**

  - Developed a software tool for predicting the likelihood of failure in irregular mechanical structures. 

  - Implemented computer code in Python to numerically model the mechanical structures (beam and shell elements). 

  - Tested and debugged the program
  
  - Conducted mathematical analysis through numerical simulations.



- **Research Assistant (2020-2021), International Tomography Center**

  - Developed a custom software solution to solve an optimization problem related to molecule structure. 

  - Collaborated with domain experts to design experiments that generated valuable data for optimization software. 

  - Utilized EasySpin (Matlab toolbox) and Pandas to handle and analyze experimental data.
