### Experience

** - Research Assistant (2021-Current), University of Houston**

I developed a computational procedure for numerical modeling and stochastic analysis of buckling imperfect structures such as columns and shells. I was in charge of programming, debugging, and testing the program to estimate the buckling response of these structures.

** - Research Assistant (2020-2021), International Tomography Center**

I was responsible for sampling and measurements of fullerene molecules. I utilized MATLAB and EasySpin toolbox to simulate, model and study fullerene molecules.
